# What's SFNuGet?

SFNuGet allows you to package and share your Microsoft Azure Service Fabric services as NuGet packages. Once your service is packaged as a NuGet package, your customers can include your service into their Service Fabric applications by simply adding a reference to your serviceâ€™s NuGet package.

To package your Service Fabric service as a reusable NuGet package, add a reference to SFNuGet and rebuild your solution - that's all you need to do! 

# Getting Started
SFNuGet is a NuGet package that helps you to build NuGet packages. The source code in this repository builds the SFNuGet NuGet package itself. To author a Service Fabric package, you need to add a SFNuGet reference to your Service Fabric application. The final consumer of your service package doesn't need a SFNuGet reference.

## Build SFNuGet
1. Clone the repository
2. Open **ReusableSFServices.sln** and rebuild the solution. 
3. You'll find the newly built **SFNuGet._\<version\>_.nupkg** under the **SFNuGet** folder.
