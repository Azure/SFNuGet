# What's SFNuGet?

SFNuGet allows you to package and share your Microsoft Azure Service Fabric services as NuGet packages. Once your service is packaged as a NuGet package, your customers can include your service into their Service Fabric applications by simply adding a reference to your serviceâ€™s NuGet package.

To package your Service Fabric service as a reusable NuGet package, use the **New-ServiceFabricNuGetPackage** method in this module.

> **NOTE** Previous versions of SFNuGet were packaged as NuGet packages, which are obsolete now.


# Getting Started
SFNuGet is a PowerShell module that helps you to build NuGet packages. After importing the module, you can use SFNuGet to package and publish NuGet packages for your Microsoft Azure Service Fabric services.

## Import SFNuGet Module
1. Clone the repository
2. Open PowerShell. 
3. Import the SFNuGet module:
```powershell
Import-Module /path/to/SFNuGetModule.psd1
```
## Package a Service Fabric as a NuGet package
To package a Service Fabric service, use the **New-ServiceFabricNuGetPackage** method on your service package folder. This folder usually is under the pkg\\Debug\\&lt;service name&gt;Pkg folder after your package your Service Fabric application.
```powershell
New-ServiceFabricNuGetPackage -InputPath <path to your Service Fabric package folder> <path to output folder>
```

## Customize you NuGet packages
The PowerShell module uses a **Package.xml** file as the template to generate NuGet package specification. When it builds your NuGet packages, it automatically reads service metadata and assembly metadata to replace placeholders (marked with '$' sign) in this file, such as $serviceName and $assemblyCompany. If you prefer, you can update this file to use customized information instead of auto-detected information. Especially, you probably want to update the **licenseUrl** to match with your licensing model.
